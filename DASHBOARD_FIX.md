# Dashboard Stats Endpoint Fix

## üêõ Issue
**Error:** 500 Internal Server Error when calling `/dashboard/stats`

**Request:**
```javascript
const res = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/dashboard/stats`);
```

## üîç Root Cause
The dashboard query was using an incorrect payment status value:
- ‚ùå **Used:** `status = 'succeeded'`
- ‚úÖ **Correct:** `status = 'paid'`

According to the `Payment` interface in `src/types/entities.ts`, the valid status values are:
```typescript
status: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'failed' | 'refunded'
```

The database query was looking for a non-existent status value, which would return `NULL` and potentially cause SQL errors.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### File Changed
`src/modules/dashboard/controllers/DashboardController.ts`

### Change Made
```diff
- COALESCE((SELECT SUM(amount)::numeric FROM payments WHERE status = 'succeeded'), ...)
+ COALESCE((SELECT SUM(amount)::numeric FROM payments WHERE status = 'paid'), ...)
```

## üìä What the Endpoint Returns

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/dashboard/stats`

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "totalUsers": 150,
    "totalOrders": 1250,
    "totalRevenue": 125000.50,
    "pendingDeliveries": 35,
    "totalFeedback": 89,
    "totalPayments": 1100
  },
  "message": "Dashboard stats retrieved successfully"
}
```

## üîÑ How It Works

The query aggregates data from multiple tables:

1. **totalUsers** = COUNT(farmers) + COUNT(drivers)
2. **totalOrders** = COUNT(orders)
3. **totalRevenue** = SUM(payments.amount WHERE status='paid') OR SUM(orders.total WHERE status='paid')
4. **pendingDeliveries** = COUNT(orders WHERE status IN ('pending','processing','shipped'))
5. **totalFeedback** = COUNT(feedback)
6. **totalPayments** = COUNT(payments)

### Fallback Logic
If tables like `payments` or `feedback` don't exist, the controller has a fallback query that uses only `orders`, `farmers`, and `drivers` tables with zero values for missing metrics.

## üß™ Testing

### 1. Test the Fixed Endpoint
```bash
# Using curl
curl http://localhost:5000/api/dashboard/stats

# Using browser/frontend
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/dashboard/stats')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

### 2. Test the Database Query
Run the test query in pgAdmin:
```sql
-- File: scripts/test_dashboard_query.sql
SELECT
  (COALESCE((SELECT COUNT(*)::int FROM farmers),0) + COALESCE((SELECT COUNT(*)::int FROM drivers),0)) as total_users,
  COALESCE((SELECT COUNT(*)::int FROM orders),0) as total_orders,
  COALESCE((SELECT SUM(amount)::numeric FROM payments WHERE status = 'paid'), (SELECT SUM(total) FROM orders WHERE status = 'paid'), 0) as total_revenue,
  COALESCE((SELECT COUNT(*)::int FROM orders WHERE status IN ('pending','processing','shipped')),0) as pending_deliveries,
  COALESCE((SELECT COUNT(*)::int FROM feedback),0) as total_feedback,
  COALESCE((SELECT COUNT(*)::int FROM payments),0) as total_payments;
```

## üìã Verification Checklist

- [x] Fixed payment status from 'succeeded' to 'paid'
- [x] Verified against Payment interface type definition
- [x] Created test SQL query for database verification
- [x] Fallback logic remains intact for missing tables
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (no errors)
- [ ] Test endpoint returns 200 OK (requires running server)
- [ ] Verify data accuracy with database records

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **If server is running with nodemon:** Changes should auto-reload
2. **If server needs manual restart:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Test the endpoint** from your frontend or using curl
4. **Verify the data** matches your database records

## üí° Additional Notes

### Payment Status Values
Make sure your payments table only uses these valid statuses:
- `pending` - Payment initiated but not completed
- `paid` - Payment successfully completed ‚úÖ Used for revenue calculation
- `failed` - Payment failed
- `refunded` - Payment was refunded

### If You Still Get Errors

1. **Check if tables exist:**
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name IN ('farmers', 'drivers', 'orders', 'payments', 'feedback');
   ```

2. **Check payment statuses in your data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT status FROM payments;
   ```

3. **Run the migration if tables are missing:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   # Or manually run: scripts/migrations/20251004_full_schema.sql
   ```

## üéâ Summary

The dashboard stats endpoint should now work correctly! The fix was simple:
- Changed `status = 'succeeded'` to `status = 'paid'` to match the actual Payment interface definition
- The endpoint will now correctly calculate total revenue from paid payments
- All other functionality remains the same with robust fallback handling

**Fixed:** October 15, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for testing
