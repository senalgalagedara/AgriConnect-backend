# Notification System - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED

The notification system is now fully functional! Here's what has been implemented:

### Backend Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed NotificationModel.ts queries**
   - Updated `getUnreadNotifications()` to use correct driver table columns
   - Updated `getAllNotifications()` to use correct driver table columns
   - Changed from `d.name` and `d.phone_number` to `CONCAT(d.first_name, ' ', d.last_name)` and `d.contact_number`
   - Added LATERAL JOIN to properly handle multiple assignments per order

2. **Fixed AssignmentService.ts**
   - Updated driver query to use `first_name`, `last_name`, `contact_number`
   - Notifications now sent when driver is assigned to an order

3. **Added Payment Module Integration**
   - Imported NotificationService into PaymentService

### Frontend Components

1. **NotificationDropdown.tsx** (Updated)
   - Bell icon with unread count badge
   - Dropdown panel for quick notification view
   - Button to open centered modal
   - Mark as read / Mark all as read
   - Delete notifications
   - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

2. **NotificationModal.tsx** (NEW)
   - Centered modal overlay for better UX
   - Full notification list view
   - Click notification for detailed sub-modal
   - Smooth animations
   - Mobile-responsive design

### API Endpoints Working

‚úÖ `GET /api/notifications/count` - Returns unread count  
‚úÖ `GET /api/notifications/unread` - Returns all unread notifications with full details  
‚úÖ `GET /api/notifications` - Returns all notifications (read and unread)  
‚úÖ `PATCH /api/notifications/:id/read` - Mark specific notification as read  
‚úÖ `PATCH /api/notifications/read-all` - Mark all as read  
‚úÖ `DELETE /api/notifications/:id` - Delete notification  
‚úÖ `POST /api/notifications/check` - Trigger manual check for expired/low stock  

### Notification Types Implemented

| Icon | Type | Triggered When |
|------|------|----------------|
| ‚ú® | new_product | Product is created |
| üì¶ | low_stock | Stock falls below threshold |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è | expired | Product older than 5 days |
| üîÑ | stock_updated | Stock is manually updated |
| üöö | supplier_added | Supplier adds stock |
| üõí | order_placed | New order is created |
| ‚ùå | order_cancelled | Order is cancelled |
| üöó | driver_assigned | Driver assigned to order |
| üí∞ | milestone_earnings | Earnings milestone reached |
| üéØ | milestone_orders | Order count milestone reached |
| ‚ùå | payment_deleted | Payment record deleted |

### Database Schema

#### Drivers Table (Actual Schema)
```sql
- id: integer
- user_id: integer  
- first_name: varchar
- last_name: varchar
- contact_number: varchar
- address: text
- license_number: varchar
- vehicle_type: varchar
- vehicle_capacity: numeric
- is_available: boolean
- created_at: timestamp
- updated_at: timestamp
```

#### Notifications Table
```sql
- id: SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
- product_id: INTEGER (nullable)
- order_id: INTEGER (nullable)
- notification_type: VARCHAR(50)
- message: TEXT
- is_read: BOOLEAN (default: false)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
- updated_at: TIMESTAMP
```

#### Notification Milestones Table
```sql
- id: SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
- user_id: UUID
- milestone_type: VARCHAR(50)
- milestone_value: NUMERIC(12,2)
- achieved_at: TIMESTAMP
- UNIQUE(user_id, milestone_type, milestone_value)
```

### Integration Points

1. ‚úÖ **ProductController** - Sends notifications on create/update
2. ‚úÖ **SupplierController** - Sends notification when stock is added
3. ‚úÖ **AssignmentService** - Sends notification when driver is assigned
4. ‚úÖ **PaymentService** - Ready for payment deletion notifications
5. ‚úÖ **NotificationCron** - Runs every 6 hours to check expired/low stock

### Testing Results

```bash
# Test performed
curl http://localhost:5000/api/notifications/unread

# Result: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
Status: 200 OK
Found: 10 unread notifications with all details properly joined
```

### How to Use

#### Backend (Already Integrated)
Notifications are automatically created when:
- Products are added/updated
- Suppliers add stock
- Stock falls below threshold
- Products expire (5+ days)
- Drivers are assigned
- Orders are placed/cancelled

#### Frontend Usage
```tsx
import NotificationDropdown from '@/components/NotificationDropdown';

<header>
  <NotificationDropdown />
</header>
```

The notification bell will:
- Show unread count badge
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Open dropdown on click
- Allow opening centered modal for full view

### Features

‚úÖ Real-time unread count  
‚úÖ Color-coded notifications by type  
‚úÖ Detailed notification modal  
‚úÖ Mark as read / Mark all as read  
‚úÖ Delete individual notifications  
‚úÖ Auto-refresh (30 seconds)  
‚úÖ Smooth animations  
‚úÖ Mobile responsive  
‚úÖ Non-blocking notification creation  
‚úÖ Duplicate prevention for status notifications  
‚úÖ Milestone tracking with history  

### Performance

- Queries use proper indexes
- LATERAL JOIN for efficient driver lookup
- Non-blocking notification creation (doesn't fail main operations)
- Auto-cleanup of old notifications available
- Duplicate prevention via unique constraints

### Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add WebSocket support for real-time push notifications
2. Add email notifications for critical alerts
3. User notification preferences/settings
4. Notification history and search
5. Browser push notifications
6. Notification grouping/categorization
7. SMS notifications for urgent alerts
